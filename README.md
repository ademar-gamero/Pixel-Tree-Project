# CompSci 351 / CompSt 751 Homework Assignment 9

This is a homework assignment at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

## Planning: Due Friday 10pm

### Focus

What is this homework assignment about?
**This homework assignment is about using a bst tree and an iterator to traverse and add to add to our pixel collection**
### Gather

What do I know?  What do I need to know that's new?
**Iterators and BSTs are not new, but implementing them together is. We have to keep track of three pointers this time**
**this added complexity is new to me and something ill have to learn**
### Brainstorm

What are some ideas for solving this homework assignment?
**Some ideas I have is using the doAdd recursion method to add things properly to my bst**
What are existing strengths I can bring to bear to solve the problems?
**my understanding of iterators and bsts since I have done assingments beforehand that use both**
What are some new skills I will need to develop?
**new skills would be increasing my understanding of recursion and managing an iterator in a bst using a linked list**
### Evaluate

What is the best way forward that I can see now?
**the best way forward is to first remove all the compilation errors, and doing activity 9**
### Plan

What will I work on first after I finish this planning part?
**I will first work on removing all compilation errors, get both invariants done, then do activity 9 to tackle the add method**
*The preceding steps should be completed and committed by the
Friday 10pm deadline.*

## Reflection: Due Monday 10pm

### Review

Did I correctly anticipate the difficulties?

How did the plan go?

### Preview

What should I do differently for next week's homework assignment?

Do I need more resources?
